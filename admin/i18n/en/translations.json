The station names can be selected on the website of the Federal Environment Agency at https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/themen/luft/luftqualitaet#luftdaten (then click on 'Nearest station') using the map displayed. The stations always begin with 'DE', followed by the federal state 'BW' and a three-digit serial number. This identifier, e.g. 'DEBW052', must then be entered in the configuration page of the adapter (confirm with Enter). Further stations can also be added here.",
